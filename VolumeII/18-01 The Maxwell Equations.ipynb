    "[1]: I originally wanted to list all the equations that became Maxwell's equations and the years in which they were originally formulated.  I was a little bothered when I couldn't find a name or year for the equation that says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero.  As I thought about it, I decided that I actually kind of like just calling it \"The Law with No Name\"."
