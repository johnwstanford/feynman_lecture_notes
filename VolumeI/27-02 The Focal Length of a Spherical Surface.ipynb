    "The real best shape to focus light between two points is a complicated 4th order curve but it's so much easier to make spherical lenses that it's better to use accept the small errors that come with them.  Considering only paraxial rays (rays close to the axis) allows us to use the $\\Delta = h^2 / 2s$ approximation from the previous section.  Consider a spherical interface between air with an index of refraction of 1 (or at least very close to 1) and glass with an index of refraction greater than 1.\n",

    "The arc passing through $VQ$ is the interface between air and glass and $R$ is the radius of curvature.  In order to focus using the Principle of Least Time (or Stationary Time, more accurately), we want to make the time between $O$ and $O'$ to be the same through many different paths.  Using the diagram, we want to make the time through the $OQO'$ path the same as through the $OPO'$ path.\n",
