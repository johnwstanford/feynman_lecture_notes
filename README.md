# Feynman Lecture Notes
This repository contains my notes on Richard Feynman's physics lectures in the form of a Jupyter notebook.  It includes:
* Points he makes that I thought were particularly interesting/powerful
* Simulations/plots of physical scenarios he describes
* Side notes on topics he assumes that you know, but that I didn't know when I first read
* etc

# Conventions
Maxwell's equations show up repeatedly in many forms throughout the notes (differential vs integral form, with or without vector potential, words instead of equations, etc) and I like to highlight the fact that they're all different forms of the same thing, so I color code them when they show up.  Ampere's Law with Maxwell's addition is red, Gauss's Law is green, Faraday's Law is blue, and "the Law with No Name" is orange.
