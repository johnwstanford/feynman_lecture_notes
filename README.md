# feynman_lecture_notes_vol2
This repository contains my notes on Volume II of Richard Feynman's physics lectures in the form of a Jupyter notebook.  It includes:
* Points he makes that I thought were particularly interesting/powerful
* Simulations/plots of physical scenarios he describes
* Side notes on topics he assumes that you know, but that I didn't know when I first read
* etc
